## Iteration 1 - 2026-01-21
**Story/Task:** TASK-001 - Fix Tailwind v4 Color Configuration
**Changes:**
- Replaced @config directive with @theme block in globals.css
- Moved all color definitions (primary, secondary, success, navy, gray-light) from tailwind.config.ts to CSS @theme
- Tailwind v4 uses CSS-first configuration - colors defined via `--color-*` in @theme become utility classes
**Files:**
- app/globals.css (added @theme block with color definitions)
- tailwind.config.ts (removed JS color config, kept fontFamily)
**Learnings:**
- Tailwind v4 requires @theme directive in CSS for custom colors to work as utility classes
- The @config directive is not needed when using CSS-first configuration
- Colors defined as `--color-primary: #hex` in @theme automatically generate bg-primary, text-primary, etc.
- Build verification is essential - colors were silently not rendering before the fix

## Iteration 2 - 2026-01-21
**Story/Task:** TASK-002 - Add Premium Typography System
**Changes:**
- Verified fonts already configured in layout.tsx (Inter + DM Serif Display via next/font/google)
- Added base CSS rule for h1-h3 to automatically apply DM Serif Display heading font
- Font smoothing and CSS variables were already in place
**Files:**
- app/globals.css (updated h1-h3 base style)
**Learnings:**
- Most typography was already configured - only needed heading font auto-application
- next/font/google with CSS variables is the correct pattern for Tailwind v4
- Check existing code before implementing - task may be partially complete
